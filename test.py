# For really complicated conditions you might need to combine some ands, ors and nots together. 
# Use parentheses if you need to make the combinations clear.

# However simple or complex, the condition in an if statement must be a boolean expression that evaluates 
# to either True or False and it is this value that decides whether the indented block in an if statement 
# executes or not.

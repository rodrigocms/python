#Errors And Exceptions
#Syntax errors occur when Python can’t interpret our code, since we didn’t follow the correct syntax 
# for Python. These are errors you’re likely to get when you make a typo, or you’re first starting 
# to learn Python.

# Exceptions occur when unexpected things happen during execution of a program, even if the code is 
# syntactically correct. There are different types of built-in exceptions in Python, and you can see 
# which exception is thrown in the error message.
